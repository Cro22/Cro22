As a seasoned Full Stack Developer and Tech Manager with over 8 years of experience in the industry, I have worked with a wide range of technologies including Node.js, NestJS, Go, React, Vue, GCP, MySQL, Redis, and Jenkins among others.

My experience includes managing teams of Tech Leads, Front-end developers, Back-end developers, QA, and Project Managers to ensure the successful delivery of software projects using various technologies such as Nodejs, React, GCP, Jenkins, MySQL, Redis, and Go.

As a back-end developer, I take pride in my ability to design and implement scalable, robust, and secure systems that meet the needs of my clients. With a strong focus on quality and scalability, I strive to deliver high-quality solutions to clients.

Fostering a positive work environment, supporting team growth, and ensuring they stay updated on the latest trends and technologies in software development is essential to achieving success in software projects.

In my current role as a Tech Manager, I manage a team of three Tech Leads, six Front-end developers, six Back-end developers, four QA, and three PMs to ensure the successful delivery of software projects using technologies such as Nodejs, React, GCP, Jenkins, MySQL, Redis, and Go.

Outside of work, I am an avid gamer and reader. I find that playing video games and diving into new books helps me relax and recharge, allowing me to return to my work with fresh perspectives and renewed energy.
